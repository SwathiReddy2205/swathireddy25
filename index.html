    <p style="color:;">* In 1968, the Government of India decided to commemorate the birth anniversary of Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya, one of India's greatest minds. Since then, National Engineers' Day is celebrated in India on September 15th each year.

    <h2> <span style="color: black;">Who</span> <span style="color: blueviolet;"> Is</span> <span style="color: chocolate;"> Mokshagundam</span> <span style="color: crimson;"> Visvesvaraya</span>?</h2>
    <p style="color:;">Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya Mokśhguṇam Viśveśvarayya (15 September 1861 – 12/14 April 1962), also referred to by his initials, MV, was an Indian civil engineer, administrator, and statesman, who served as the 19th Dewan of Mysore from 1912 to 1918.</p>
    <p style="color:;">Visvesvaraya is regarded in India as one of the foremost civil engineers whose birthday, 15 September, is celebrated every year as Engineer's Day in India, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania. He is also often regarded as "the maker of modern Mysore".</p>
    <p style="color:;">Visvesvaraya worked as a civil engineer for the government of British India and later as Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Mysore. For his services to British India, he was appointed CIE and later knighted KCIE. For his services to the Kingdom of Mysore and the Republic of India, he was awarded the Bharata Ratna by Government of India in 1955</p>

    <h2 style="color:brown;">Introduction:-</h2>

    <P style="color:;">*Engineering is the practice of using natural science, mathematics, and the engineering design process to solve technical problems, increase efficiency and productivity, and improve systems. Modern engineering comprises many subfields which include designing and improving infrastructure, machinery, vehicles, electronics, materials, and energy systems.

        
        <br>*The discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range of more specialized fields of engineering, each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of applied mathematics, applied science, and types of application. See glossary of engineering.
        
       <br> *The term engineering is derived from the Latin ingenium, meaning "cleverness" and ingeniare, meaning "to contrive, devise".</P>

       <h2> <span style="color: red;">History</span> <span style="color: aqua;">Of</span> <span style="color: chartreuse;"> Engineering</span>:-</h2>
<p style="color: ;">Engineering has existed since ancient times, when humans devised inventions such as the wedge, lever, wheel and pulley, etc.</p>
<p style="color: ;">The term engineering is derived from the word engineer, which itself dates back to the 14th century when an engine'er (literally, one who builds or operates a siege engine) referred to "a constructor of military engines". In this context, now obsolete, an "engine" referred to a military machine, i.e., a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a catapult). Notable examples of the obsolete usage which have survived to the present day are military engineering corps, e.g., the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
</p>
<p style="color:;">The word "engine" itself is of even older origin, ultimately deriving from the Latin ingenium , meaning "innate quality, especially mental power, hence a clever invention."</p>

</details>
</center>
    <p style="color: darkgreen;">Born in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Fazlur Rahman Khan can claim the title of father of the modern skyscraper. This structural engineer and architect came up with tubular designs that allowed for easier construction of the high-rise structures we know today. Khan was one of the first to use computer-aided design techniques, and he gave the US the Willis Tower and John Hancock Center.</p>

</details>
</center>
    <p style="color:blue;">American Burt Rutan is an aerospace engineer and modern entrepreneur. Rutan's aircraft were often peculiar-looking but they always proved to be light, strong and energy-efficient. His greatest achievements include Voyager, the first plane to fly non-stop around the world, and SpaceShipOne, the first privately funded spacecraft to make regular and successful trips into sub-orbit.</p>

    <summary style="color: crimson;">Ada Lovelace (1815–1852)</summary>
</details>
</center>
    <p style="color: blue;">Daughter of the poet Lord Byron, Ada Lovelace was a mathematician who engineered the first computer programme. She worked with Charles Babbage, where she was instructed to translate an Italian article about the ‘Different Engine’. She added her own comments to the translation to a great extent, thus creating an algorithm that was to be used by the machine. Lovelace later developed many more methods for computers to do more than just calculate numbers.</p>

    <p style="color: darkgreen;">Engineer, businessman, inventor – three of the many labels often attached to South African-born Canadian Musk. Founder of SpaceX, which is working towards an ultimate goal of enabling humans to live on other planets; Tesla Motors, where electric cars are created to discourage the use of fossil fuels in transport; and The Boring Company, which aims to create networks of tunnels in and around cities for fast, safe transportation. Other achievements include starting the Musk Foundation, which funds engineering education and research.</p>

</details>
</center>
    <p style="color:darkgreen;">Born in New Jersey, Alice H Parker is the reason why you have central heating in your home. Dissatisfied with the effectiveness of her fireplace in cold winters, the African American inventor designed a heating system that exchanged cool air for heat. Using natural gas for fuel instead of wood and coal, the warmth could be spread to rooms around the house. This invention also reduced the risk of fires in buildings from excessive use of fireplaces.</p>

</details>
</center>
     <p style="color:blue;">Inventor, former astronaut and director of NASA’s Johnson Space Center, Ellen Ochoa has had a huge impact in the aerospace industry. She co-created three inventions: an optical object recognition method, an optical inspection system, and a method for noise removal. Ochoa was the world’s first Hispanic female astronaut and has spent more than 950 hours in space. She's also the second woman to be director of the Johnson Space Center.</p>

    <summary style="color: crimson;">George Stephenson (1781–1848)</summary>
</details>
</center>
<p style="color: blue;">We could've easily included on this list George Stephenson’s son Robert, known as one of the greatest engineers of the 19th century. George gets the nod however, for doing it all first – he built the first public intercity railway line between Liverpool and Manchester in 1830. His rail gauge is still used all over the world as the standard measurement for rail tracks.</p>

</details>
</center>
<p style="color: darkgreen;">Known as the first-ever female field engineer, Emily Warren Roebling played a significant part in completing the Brooklyn Bridge. Her husband was a civil engineer who developed a disease during his time working on the bridge. He was unable to continue, so Roebling took the reins and became chief engineer for the project for the next 14 years. After its completion in 1883, she was the first person to cross it.</p>

</details>
</center>
<p style="color:darkgreen;">Isambard Kingdom Brunel has had an overwhelming impact on the infrastructure of modern UK. It's appropriate he's on this list too, having given his name to a modern-day university (Brunel University London). His achievements include the Great Western Railway and the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol. Brunel built railways across England, Wales, Ireland and Italy, and advised on rail lines in Australia and India</p>

    <summary style="color: crimson;">Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519)</summary>
</details>
</center>
<p style="color: blue;">Da Vinci was good at many things: painting, sculpting, architecture, science, music, mathematics, engineering, invention, anatomy, geology, astronomy, botany, writing, history, cartography, you name it. His engineering concepts were unfathomable at the time and still carry an air of magic with them today – flying machines, a type of armoured fighting vehicle, concentrated solar power, an adding machine, and the double hull. Few were feasible then but are central to how we live today.</p>
